## Responses

1. Please complete the tasks outlined in the instructions video. Why did you choose the approach you took? Which problems did you encounter?

New components 'alerts', 'warning' and 'success' were created.  I chose a simple, single-word naming convention because I am not sure what angular conventions I would run against if I used dashes, camel case and/or underscores.  I chose separate css files for both warning and success after first trying to define all styles in the the css file for alerts.  I used the code that I created in the previous chapters (added to GitHub for easy reference) to overcome a few issues...namely remembering where to import and declare my components (in app.module.ts).  I would like to learn more about the export class statement in app.module.ts...specifically when you would and wouldn't need to add the OnInit code to your component's ts files.
